1_Write a function named fizzbuzz that takes in an array of numbers.
Iterate over the array using forEach to determine the output based on several rules:
  - If a number is divisible by 3, add the word "Fizz" to the output array.
  - If the number is divisible by 5, add the word "Buzz" to the output array.
  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add the phrase "Fizz Buzz" to the output array.
  - Otherwise, add the number to the output array.
Return the resulting output array.

2-Write a function named forLoopTwoToThe that, given an array of integers as input, iterates over the array and returns a new array. The returned array should contain the result of raising 2 to the power of the original input element.

For example, twoToThe([1,2,3]) returns [2,4,8] because 2 ^ 1 = 2, 2 ^ 2 = 4, and 2 ^ 3 = 8.

3-Write a function named oddValues that, given an array of integers as input, uses filter to return an array containing only the odd integers.
