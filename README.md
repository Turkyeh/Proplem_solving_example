***********************
1-Converting from uppercase letters to lowercase letters and vice versa use map in higher order function;

2زConverting from a negative number to a positive number and  vice verse

1_Write a function named fizzbuzz that takes in an array of numbers.
Iterate over the array using forEach to determine the output based on several rules:
  - If a number is divisible by 3, add the word "Fizz" to the output array.
  - If the number is divisible by 5, add the word "Buzz" to the output array.
  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add the phrase "Fizz Buzz" to the output array.
  - Otherwise, add the number to the output array.
Return the resulting output array.
***********************************************************************************
2-Write a function named forLoopTwoToThe that, given an array of integers as input, iterates over the array and returns a new array. The returned array should contain the result of raising 2 to the power of the original input element.

For example, twoToThe([1,2,3]) returns [2,4,8] because 2 ^ 1 = 2, 2 ^ 2 = 4, and 2 ^ 3 = 8.
*********************************************************************************************************
3-Write a function named oddValues that, given an array of integers as input, uses filter to return an array containing only the odd integers.

**********************************************************************************************************************
4-Write a function named countNumberOfElements that, given an array as input, uses reduce to count the number of elements in the array.
Note: You may not use the array's built-in length property.

Map/filter/reduce :

map([🌽, 🐮, 🐔], cook)
=> [🍿, 🍔, 🍳]

filter([🍿, 🍔, 🍳], isVegetarian)
=>  [🍿, 🍳]

reduce([🍿, 🍳], eat)
=> 💩
